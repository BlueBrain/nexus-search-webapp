  "description": "The α-subunit of the Kv1 family are mammalian homologous of the Shaker subunits originally described in Drosophila[1348]. Multiple members of the Kv1(Kv1.1-1.6) subfamily have been found in the CNS. Kv1.1 is a shaker voltage-gated potassium channel encoded by the KCNA1 gene [252]. Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are low-voltage activated (LVA) channels that open with small depolarizations at or below rest- ing potential [1590] Kcna1 gene is conserved in human, chimpanzee, dog, cow, mouse, chicken and zebra fish. The α-subunit of Kv1 are known to form heteromultimers [734]. In the nervous system Kv1.1 appears to be widely distributed; it is highly expressed in the juxtaparanodal regions of myelinated axons. However, the channel is also expressed in unmyelinated axons, cell somas, axon terminals, and in some dendrites [734]. Disruption of the Kcna1 gene in mice has displayed frequent spontaneous seizures. [1345].",
