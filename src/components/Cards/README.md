#Cards

These are the search snippet result cards. Each file corresponds to an `@type`, which is how the entities provided by search are seperated into the primary categories.

You can simply add a card component here as `MyType.js` and whenever a search result is found with `@type: MyType` it will render the card. Otherwise, a default card type will be used.
